# Miner application API compatibility

The authenticated `/api/v1` surface is the stable boundary between a Bitcast X
miner node and any creator product built on it. It is deliberately separate
from the signed validator protocol mounted on the same process. Platform user
sessions, wallet connections, creator payments, and product-specific policy
belong outside this API.

OpenAPI is served at `/api/v1/openapi.json` and Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs`.
Both require `Authorization: Bearer <BITCAST_X_MINER_API_TOKEN>`, like every
other `/api/v1` route. Use a unique token containing at least 256 bits of
entropy and terminate TLS before exposing a node beyond localhost.

By default `/api/v1` shares `BITCAST_X_PORT` with the validator protocol, which
must be publicly reachable. Set `BITCAST_X_MINER_API_PORT` to serve the
application API on its own listener instead: the validator port then carries
only the protocol, and `/api/v1` binds to `BITCAST_X_MINER_API_HOST`
(default `127.0.0.1`). Use `0.0.0.0` only when something in front of it (a
container network or a TLS-terminating proxy) keeps it private. The two
listeners share one process and lifecycle; if either stops, both stop.

Collection responses use `{ "items": [...], "next_cursor": null,
"has_more": false }`. Clients must tolerate additive response fields and
unknown error codes. Mutations require an `Idempotency-Key` of 8–256 characters;
reusing a key with a different payload returns `409 idempotency_conflict`.
`external_id` lets a platform reconcile its own durable record without making
that identifier protocol-authoritative.

Every submission requires the immutable numeric `creator_x_id` resolved from the authenticated
platform session. The miner commits it into the protocol event; validators independently compare
it with the fetched tweet author before a direct/exclusive submission can be attributed.

For an exclusive direct campaign, central campaign capabilities may keep `can_submit` enabled
while the campaign is `evaluating`. This is the submission grace period for tweets that already
exist; it does not extend the posting window. The creator must remain historically `eligible`, and
validators still reject tweets published after the campaign's `closes_at`. Claims and new
publications remain closed during this period, so `eligible_if_published_now` stays false.
Before confirming a grace-period submission, the miner forces its durable event on-chain and
checks the finalized block against `scoring_close_block`. A commitment that lands after the
deadline returns `409 submission_deadline_passed`; a commitment not confirmed within the bounded
request window of at most 30 seconds returns retryable
`503 submission_commitment_pending`. Open-window submissions remain asynchronously batched.

All `/api/v1` responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store`. Errors use:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "creator_not_eligible",
    "message": "Human-readable detail.",
    "retryable": false
  }
}
```

The node signs central reads with its miner hotkey. The central API requires
that hotkey to be currently registered on netuid 93. A deregistered hotkey is
reported as `403 miner_not_registered`; chain/RPC unavailability is
`503 central_api_unavailable`; central throttling is
`429 central_api_rate_limited` and preserves `Retry-After`.

## Evolution rules

* Additive optional response fields and new error codes are compatible in v1.
* Removing, renaming, narrowing, or changing the meaning of an existing field,
  capability, status, authentication rule, or idempotency behavior is not.
* An incompatible contract is published under a new path version. Old and new
  versions overlap for at least the longest supported campaign plus its result
  retention window.
* The OpenAPI route contract and consumer tests in the reference template and
  Stitch3 must pass before a compatible change merges.
* Consensus protocol versioning remains governed separately by
  [protocol-compatibility.md](protocol-compatibility.md).

This separation avoids implementation drift without duplicating scoring: the
node reuses its protocol engine and central result client, while the application
projection owns authentication, stable naming, collection envelopes,
idempotency, and errors.
